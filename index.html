                            emorating the birth of Jesus Christ,
                            observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of
                            people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preced
                            ed by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide,
                            which
                            historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night.
                            Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority
                            of
                            Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and
                            forms an integral part of the holiday season organized around it.

                            The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of
                            Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies
                            When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a
                            stable
                            where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who
                            then
                            spread the word.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul <li>
                        There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus' birth and in the early fourth
                        century, the church fixed the date as December 25. This corresponds to the traditional date of
                        the winter solstice on the Roma
                        n calendar. It is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the date of the
                        spring equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has
                        been adopted almost universally
                        in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern
                        Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which
                        currently corresponds to January 7 in
                        the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of
                        man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than knowing Jesus' exact birth date, is
                        considered to be the primary purpose in
                        celebrating Christmas.

                            The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have
                            a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular modern customs of
                            the
                            h
                            oliday include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music
                            and
                            caroling; viewi
                            ng a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; church services; a special meal; and the
                            display of various Christmas decora
                            tions, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths,
                            mistletoe, and holly. In addition, several closely related and often interchangea
                            ble figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are
                            associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own
                            body
                            of traditions and lore.
                            Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened
                            economic
                            activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers
                            and
                            businesses. Over the
                            past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic effect in many regions of
                            the
                            world.

                        The English word "Christmas" is a short
                        ened form of "Christ's Mass". The word is record
                        ed as Crīstesmæsse in 1038 and Cristes-messe in 1131. Crīst (genitive Crīstes) is from Greek
                        Khrīstos (Χριστός), a tra
                        nslation of Hebrew Māšîaḥ (מָשִׁיחַ), "Messiah", meaning "anointed";and mæsse is from Latin
                        missa, the celebration of the Eucharist.


                        The form Christenmas was also used during some periods, but is now considered archaic and
                        dialectal. The term derives from Middle English Cr
                        istenmasse, meaning "Christian mass". Xmas is an abbreviation of Christmas found particu
                        larly in print, based on the initial letter chi (Χ) in Greek Khrīstos (Χριστός) ("Christ"),
                        although som
                        e style guides discourage its use. This abbreviation has precedent in Middle English Χρ̄es masse
                        (where "Χρ̄" is an abbreviation for Χριστός).

                        Other names
                        In addition to "Christmas", the holiday has had various other English names throughout its
                        history. The Anglo-Saxons referred to the feast as "midwinter", or, more rarely, as
                        Nātiuiteð (from Latin nātīvitās below)."Nativity", meaning "birth", is from Latin
                        nātīvitās.In Old English, Gēola (Yule) referred to the period corresponding to December and
                        January, which was eventually equated with Christian Christmas. "Noel" (also "Nowel" or
                        "Nowell", as in "The First Nowell") entered English in the late 14th century and is from the Old
                        French noël or naël, itself ultimately from the Latin nātālis (diēs) meaning "birth (day)".

                        The nativity sequences included in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke prompted early Christian
                        writers to suggest var
                        ious dates for the anniversary. Although no date is indicated in the gospels, early Christians
                        connected Jesus to the
                        Sun through the use of such phrases as "Sun of righteousness." The Romans marked the winter
                        solstice on December 25.

                        The first recorded Christmas celebration was in Rome on December 25, AD 336. In the 3rd century,
                        the date of
                        the nativity was the subject of great interest. Around AD 200, Clement of Alexandria wrote:


                        There are those who have determined not only the year of our Lord's birth, but also the day; and
                        they say that
                        it took place in the 28th year of Augustus, and in the 25th day of [the Egyptian month] Pachon
                        [May 20] ... Further, o
                        thers say that He was born on the 24th or 25th of Pharmuthi [April 20 or 21].


                        Various factors contributed to the selection of December 25 as a date of celebration: it was the
                        date of the winter sols
                        tice on the Roman calendar and it was nine months after March 25, the date of the vernal equinox
                        and a d1
                        Christmas played a role in the Arian controversy of the fourth century. After this controversy
                        ran its cours
                        e, the prominence of the holiday declined for a few centuries. The feast regained prominence
                        after 800 when Charlemagne wa
                        s crowned emperor on Christmas Day.


                        In Puritan England, Christmas was banned, with Puritans considering it a Catholic invention and
                        also asso
                        ciating the day with drunkenness and other misbehaviour. It was restored as a legal holiday in
                        England in 1660 when Purita
                        n legislation was declared null and void, but it remained disreputable in the minds of
                        some. In the early 19th century, Christmas festivities and
                        services became widespread with the ris
                        e of the Oxford Movement in the Church of England that emphasized the centrality of Christmas in
                        Christianity and charity to the poor, along with Washington Irving, Charles Dickens,
                        and other authors emphasizing family, children, kind-heartedness, gift-giving, and Santa Claus
                        (for Irving), or Father Christmas (for Dickens)
